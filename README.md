You are able to make a :
- pull : to update your local version from the github server version.
- commit&push : to update the github version from your local work

Now we should choose our language and framework (You should see what it does mean first!)
You should see what CSS, JS, MFC, AngularJS, NodeJS, ionic, jquery, symfony and dotnet are.
You should also see what is :
- the best language for ios and android app development.
- the best framework for ios and android app development.
- the best IDE for ios and android app development.

As you can guess we are making an app for ios and android.
This app will be a simple tool to be used for learning the solfa and how to play them.
